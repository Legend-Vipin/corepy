# 📖 Usage Guide

Corepy is designed to be familiar if you have used tools like NumPy or Pandas, but with added safety and speed.

> [!NOTE]
> **Version 0.2.0 Status**: This guide shows what's currently working (✅) and what's planned for future releases (🔮).

---

## ✅ Working Features (v0.2.0)

These examples work in the current released version and have been tested.

---

### 🌟 Example 1: Basic Tensor Creation and Addition

The core feature currently working is tensor creation and addition operations.

```python
import corepy as cp

# Create tensors with list data
a = cp.Tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
b = cp.Tensor([4.0, 5.0, 6.0])

print(f"Tensor a: {a}")
# Output: Tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], backend='cpu')

print(f"Tensor b: {b}")
# Output: Tensor([4.0, 5.0, 6.0], backend='cpu')

# Element-wise addition (fully supported)
c = a + b
print(f"a + b = {c}")
# Output: Tensor([5.0, 7.0, 9.0], backend='cpu')
```

**What works:**
- ✅ Tensor creation from Python lists
- ✅ Element-wise addition (`+`)
- ✅ CPU backend (automatic)

**What doesn't work yet:**
- ❌ Subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), division (`/`)
- ❌ Scalar operations (e.g., `tensor * 2.0`)
- ❌ Matrix multiplication (`@`)

---

### 🔍 Example 2: Device Detection

Corepy can detect your system's hardware capabilities automatically.

```python
from corepy.backend import detect_devices

# Get comprehensive system information
info = detect_devices()

print(f"CPU Cores: {info.cpu_cores}")
print(f"Has AVX2: {info.has_avx2}")
print(f"Has AVX-512: {info.has_avx512}")
print(f"Has NEON: {info.has_neon}")
print(f"GPU Count: {info.gpu_count}")
print(f"Platform: {info.platform_system}")
```

**Example Output (Linux x86_64)**:
```
CPU Cores: 4
Has AVX2: True
Has AVX-512: False
Has NEON: False
GPU Count: 0
Platform: Linux
```

**Example Output (Apple M1)**:
```
CPU Cores: 8
Has AVX2: False
Has AVX-512: False
Has NEON: True
GPU Count: 1
Platform: Darwin
```

**Use Cases:**
- Understand what hardware optimizations are available
- Adapt your code based on CPU capabilities
- Debug platform-specific issues

---

### 📊 Example 3: Data Tables

Basic data table functionality for structured data.

```python
from corepy.data import Table

# Create a table from a dictionary
data = {
    "name": ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"],
    "score": [95.5, 87.3, 92.1],
    "age": [25, 30, 28]
}

table = Table(data)
print(table)
# Output: Table(rows=3, schema=None)
```

**Status**: Basic functionality works. Schema integration and advanced operations coming in future versions.

---

### 🏗️ Example 4: Understanding the Backend System

Corepy uses a backend abstraction for future CPU/GPU support.

```python
from corepy.backend import CPUBackend, CPUDevice

# CPU backend is used by default
backend = CPUBackend()
device = CPUDevice(device_id=0)

print(f"Backend: {backend}")
print(f"Device: {device}")
```

**Current Status:**
- ✅ CPU backend architecture in place
- ✅ Device detection working
- 🔮 GPU backend planned for v2.0

---

### 📝 Example 5: Checking Package Installation

Verify your Corepy installation is working correctly.

```python
import corepy as cp

# Check version
print(f"Corepy version: {cp.__version__}")

# Check available modules
available = [attr for attr in dir(cp) if not attr.startswith('_')]
print(f"Available modules: {', '.join(available)}")

# Test basic operation
try:
    result = cp.Tensor([1, 2, 3]) + cp.Tensor([4, 5, 6])
    print(f"✅ Basic operations working: {result}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"❌ Error: {e}")
```

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts (v1)

Understanding Corepy's design philosophy:

1. **Correctness First**: Corepy prioritizes getting the right answer over raw speed. Operations fail fast rather than silently producing incorrect results.

2. **Eager Execution**: v1 uses straightforward, eager execution—what you write is what executes immediately (lazy graphs planned for v2).

3. **CPU-Optimized**: v1 focuses exclusively on CPU performance using C++ SIMD optimizations (GPU support planned for v2).

4. **Backend Abstraction**: The architecture is designed for future multi-device support, even though v1 is CPU-only.

5. **Type Safety**: Strong type hints and schema integration prevent common data pipeline errors.

B = cp.Tensor([[5, 6], [7, 8]])
C = A @ B          # ❌ Matrix multiplication

# Reductions
sum_val = a.sum()  # ❌ Not implemented
mean_val = a.mean()  # ❌ Not implemented
```

**Planned for**: v0.3 (1-2 months)

---

### 🎯 Future Example: GPU Acceleration

**Status**: 🔮 Planned for v2.0  
**Dependencies**: GPU backend, Device transfer

```python
import corepy as cp

# GPU support coming in v2.0
tensor_cpu = cp.Tensor([1, 2, 3], device="cpu")

# Move to GPU
tensor_gpu = tensor_cpu.to("cuda:0")  # ❌ Not implemented

# Operations automatically run on GPU
result = tensor_gpu * 2.0  # ❌ Not implemented

# Move back to CPU
result_cpu = result.to("cpu")  # ❌ Not implemented
```

**Planned for**: v2.0 (6-12 months)

---

### 🧪 Future Example: Reference Backend for Testing

**Status**: 🔮 Exists but not exposed in v0.2  
**Dependencies**: Expose ReferenceBackend in public API

```python
import corepy as cp
from corepy.backend import ReferenceBackend  # ❌ Not exposed yet

# Test C++ implementation against pure Python
a = [[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]]
b = [[5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0]]

# C++ optimized path
result_cpp = cp.matmul(a, b)  # ❌ Not implemented

# Pure Python reference (slow but correct)
result_ref = ReferenceBackend.matmul(a, b)  # ❌ Not exposed

# Should always match
assert result_cpp == result_ref
```

**Planned for**: v0.3 (exposed in public API)

---

### 🚀 Future Example: Lazy Execution and Optimization

**Status**: 🔮 Planned for v2.0  
**Dependencies**: Execution graph, Graph optimizer

```python
import corepy as cp

# Create computation graph (lazy)
x = cp.Tensor([1, 2, 3])
y = cp.Tensor([4, 5, 6])

# These don't execute immediately - they build a graph
z = x + y
w = z * 2
result = w.sum()

# Execution happens here, with optimizations
final = result.compute()  # ❌ Lazy execution not implemented

# Corepy will optimize:
# - Fuse operations (add + multiply + sum in one kernel)
# - Choose best device (CPU vs GPU)
# - Minimize memory allocations
```

**Planned for**: v2.0 (lazy execution graph system)

---

## 💡 Best Practices (Current Version)

### ✅ Do This

```python
# Use tensor addition (works)
a = cp.Tensor([1, 2, 3])
b = cp.Tensor([4, 5, 6])
result = a + b

# Check device capabilities
info = detect_devices()
if info.has_avx2:
    print("AVX2 available for future optimizations")

# Use Data.Table for structured data
from corepy.data import Table
table = Table({"col1": [1, 2], "col2": [3, 4]})
```

### ❌ Don't Do This (Yet)

```python
# These don't work in v0.2.0
result = a - b         # ❌ Not implemented
result = a * 2.0       # ❌ Not implemented
result = cp.io.read()  # ❌ Module doesn't exist
```
