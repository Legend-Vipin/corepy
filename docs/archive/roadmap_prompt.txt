Create a detailed development roadmap for Corepy (Python+C++/Rust library) based on the following timeline: [INSERT TIMELINE HERE, e.g., "2 years", "18 months", "6 months"]

Structure the roadmap with milestones every [TIMELINE/4] period. For example:
- If timeline is 2 years → milestones every 6 months (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4)
- If timeline is 1 year → milestones every 3 months
- If timeline is 6 months → milestones every 6 weeks

Include for each milestone:
1. **Version number** (e.g., v0.3, v1.0, v2.0)
2. **Key features** to implement
3. **Tech stack focus** (Python/C++/Rust percentages)
4. **Deliverables** (what users get)
5. **Success metrics** (downloads, performance, etc.)

Focus areas by priority:
- v0.3-v0.5: Fix foundation (C++ extension in wheel, all tensor operations, testing)
- v0.6-v1.0: Performance (SIMD kernels, benchmarks, multi-threading)
- v1.1-v2.0: Rust runtime (work-stealing scheduler, memory safety, GPU backend)
- v2.0+: Advanced features (lazy execution, distributed, mixed-precision)

Current status: v0.2.0 (only tensor addition works, C++ extension not in wheel, Rust is minimal)
