This is the wrong question! Instead ask:
  ✅ "Is this operation slower than expected for THIS data size?"
  ✅ "Is this operation taking a disproportionate amount of total time?"
  ✅ "Could this operation run faster on different hardware?"

Let's learn how to answer these questions!

💡 INSIGHT:
The large data operation takes longer, but that's EXPECTED!
What matters is:
  - Is it proportionally slower? (10000 elements ≈ 2000x more data)
  - Is the time per element roughly constant?

If processing 2000x more data takes 10000x longer, something's wrong!

💡 INSIGHT:
Even though 'add' was called 100 times, 'matmul' might take MORE total time!

The '% Total' column shows:
  ✅ Which operations dominate your runtime
  ✅ Where optimization efforts should focus

RULE OF THUMB:
  - Operations taking >50% of time → High priority to optimize
  - Operations taking 10-50% → Medium priority
  - Operations taking <10% → Don't waste time optimizing these!

WHAT IS A BASELINE?
A baseline is your expected performance for a given operation and data size.

HOW TO CREATE BASELINES:
1. Profile on known-good hardware with typical data
2. Record the timings
3. Compare future runs against these baselines
4. Flag operations that are >2x slower than baseline

EXAMPLE BASELINES (CPU, 1000 elements):

    "matmul": "0.50 ms"
}

print("""
If your profiling shows:
  ✅ add:  0.01 ms → Normal (matches baseline)
  ❌ sum:  5.00 ms → SLOW! (100x slower than expected)
  
The slow operation is your optimization target!

print("""
The 'Backend' column shows WHERE your operation ran:
  - CPU: Central Processing Unit (your computer's main processor)
  - GPU: Graphics Processing Unit (much faster for parallel work)

WHEN TO USE EACH:

CPU is faster for:
  ✅ Small data (< 1000 elements)
  ✅ Sequential operations
  ✅ Simple arithmetic

GPU is faster for:
  ✅ Large data (> 10,000 elements)
  ✅ Matrix operations
  ✅ Parallel reductions

EXAMPLE:
  matmul on 10,000 elements:
    - CPU: 20 ms
    - GPU: 2 ms (10x faster!)
  
  add on 100 elements:
    - CPU: 0.01 ms
    - GPU: 0.50 ms (slower due to data transfer overhead!)

💡 INSIGHT:
The 'mean' operation was called 50 times!
Looking at the code, we see it's inside a loop but the result doesn't change.

BEFORE (buggy):
  for i in range(50):
      m = data.mean()  # ← Called 50 times
      results.append(data - m)

AFTER (fixed):
  m = data.mean()      # ← Called once!

1. CONTEXT MATTERS
   - 5 ms on 1M elements is great!
   - 5 ms on 10 elements is terrible!

2. FOCUS ON % TOTAL
   - Optimize operations taking >50% of time first
   - Don't waste time on operations <10% of total

3. CREATE BASELINES
   - Profile typical workloads on your hardware
   - Compare future runs to detect regressions

4. CHECK BACKENDS
   - Large data + matmul → Use GPU
   - Small data + simple ops → Use CPU

5. LOOK FOR PATTERNS
   - High operation count → Maybe batch?
   - Unexpected slow operations → Might be a bug!

GOLDEN RULE:
"Measure, don't guess. Profile, then optimize."
